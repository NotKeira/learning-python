# Imports

# Functions
def process_list(list):
    pass  # TODO: Write your code here


# Main
def main():
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        process_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16])  # Easy
        # process_list([10040430, 234251, 5432526, 65464542, 622, 8, "hi", "10412341", '~@'])  # Medium
        # process_list([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, '', '12341', TypeError])  # Hard
